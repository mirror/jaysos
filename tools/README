This directory contains tools for creating GBFS archive files
and listing their contents.

JaysOS uses GBFS archives to provide a way for apps to
read files from the rom image.

the program "gbfs" creates an archive file that can then
simply be cat-ed onto the end of your rom file.
e.g.

   gbfs stuff.gbfs  photos  docs

will create an archive file "stuff.gbfs" containing all the files
in the photos and docs directories.


"lsgbfs" lists the contents of the archive file.


These tools and the library functions used within
JaysOS to read them are based on code written by Damian Yerrick.

I made the following modifications to Damian's 20020404 release:

- the "gbfs" tool can now create archives from files in directories
  so you can create an archive from a hierachy of files.
  GBFS only really has one directory, so when you do this
  the files simply get added with the directory name and seperating
  slashes as part of their name.

- max pathname is now 128 chars
 
- renamed GBFS_FILE to GBFS_ARCHIVE

- generally changed the way in which the archive file is created

- i removed the "ungbfs" tool, because it was broken by my changes, 
  and i was too lazy to fix it ;)
