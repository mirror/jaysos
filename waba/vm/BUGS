* Error with empty arrays of String (possibly arrays of anything),
  when passed by startApplication. Passed from java method is ok.

* In application mode, one can specify a class to run, and pass it
  arguments from the shell command line. If no argument is given, the
  VM thinks one empty arg is passed (with one or more args, it is
  okay). This is a problem with empty arrays of String.

* Passing an argument of more than 40 for the main class name
  cause waba to not find it.
